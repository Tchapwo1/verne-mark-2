Verne Daily is an intelligence briefing for the builders, leaders, and architects of the AI era.

We believe that the future of artificial intelligence will not be distributed evenly—it will be distributed to those who understand the systems, the incentives, and the architecture of what comes next.

## Our Mission

To decode the signal from the noise. Every day, thousands of papers, demos, and press releases flood the ecosystem. Most of it is fast-food content designed for engagement. Verne Daily is designed for *understanding*.

We focus on:
*   **System Architecture:** How things actually work under the hood.
*   **Economic Incentives:** Why models are released when they are.
*   **Operational Security:** How enterprises can safely deploy agents.

## The Team

Verne Daily is written by Jacques, a systems architect and researcher focused on the intersection of Large Language Models and Enterprise Software.
